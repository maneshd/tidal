About the piece:
----------------

BRANCH is a piece which uses the Tidal Cycles
live coding language alongside a tool we
developed called SHARP. SHARP provides a
tree-like structure embedded in the text editor
which allows the performer to quickly switch
between different versions of their code.
With BRANCH, we try to highlight the interplay
between musical form, its representation in
SHARP, and the sonic material itself. To that
end, BRANCH makes use of machine-generated
speech based mostly on snippets from Robert
Frost's poem "The Road Not Taken". The text
is largely decontextualized, and its treatment
is somewhat tongue-in-cheek: while the poem's
premise centers around not being able to take
both paths, we can easily explore as many
paths in our code as we wish.
